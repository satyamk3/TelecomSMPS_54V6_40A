Sample Component Connections
 Power Stage
 1. Bridge Rectifier → EMI filter → PFC Stage (using GaN transistor) to boost voltage.
 2. PFC Output → Bulk Capacitors → LLC Resonant Converter Primary Side (using GaN
 half-bridge and transformer).
 3. Transformer Secondary → Synchronous Rectification (GaN FETs with UCC24612 control) →
 Output LC Filter.

Control and Feedback
 1. Voltage Feedback from the output through a resistor divider back to the UCC256403 for
 constant voltage control.
 2. Current Feedback using the current sense resistor, fed into the BQ24650 to control current
 limiting and switch between CC and CV modes.
 3. MCU (optional) to communicate with the BMS and adjust the current dynamically based on
 battery status.

Protections
 1. Over-Voltage: If the output voltage exceeds safe limits, the LM5060 disconnects the output.
 2. Over-Temperature: Thermistors are monitored by the MCU or BQ24650 to reduce or stop
 charging if components overheat.--

Notes
 Cooling: GaN FETs are highly efficient but still generate some heat, so a small heatsink or fan
 on critical components might be necessary.
 PCB Layout: Pay close attention to PCB layout, especially around the GaN FETs, to minimize
 parasitic inductance and capacitance.
 Transformer Design: If isolation is required, the transformer must be custom-wound for the
 correct turns ratio and should be designed for high-frequency operation.
 This setup provides a solid foundation for a high-efficiency, adjustable SMPS battery charger
 using GaN transistors.
